                    I started learning computer peograming on my own aged 8 and grew not to only like it but loved it. I did mostly of my learnings from watching youtube videos and from my big sis who is a full time programmer.

                <p3>My first programming language was C programming and then after i started learning other programming languages like Html, css, javascript, c++, python and java. I did other computer courses like web development,
                    data entry etc....
